# Armazenamento Cheio | A Web Documentary

## What Is This Project?

**Armazenamento Cheio** is an interactive web documentary (also known as a "webdoc") that explores the fascinating world of collecting. Instead of a traditional documentary film, this project lives online and invites visitors to virtually meet three passionate collectors from Portuguese communities.

The title translates to "Storage Full"—a playful reference to the collector's dilemma: they have so many items they've run out of space, and they love it that way.

## The Story

Collecting is more than a hobby—it's a lifestyle. This documentary features three real people who have dedicated their lives to collecting:

- **Alice Oliveira** - A devoted Benfica football club fan whose home is filled with memorabilia spanning decades
- **Aníbal Simão** - A barber in Oliveira de Azeméis who collects Elvis Presley artifacts and has transformed his barbershop into a museum
- **Vitor Coutinho** - A jeweler in Viana do Castelo whose passion for The Beatles has taken over his home and workspace

Through video interviews, photo galleries, and personal stories, visitors learn why these collectors are so devoted to their collections and how collecting shapes their daily lives.

## Project Type

This is a **multimedia web experience**—a creative output from university students learning professional documentary and web design. It combines:

- **Video interviews** (hosted on YouTube)
- **Photo galleries** (carousel displays of collection items)
- **Interactive navigation** (explore at your own pace)
- **Engaging design** (retro Windows 95 aesthetic for visual appeal)
- **Educational content** (learn about collecting culture)

## How to Access It

Simply open `index.html` in any web browser. The entire experience loads instantly with no software installation needed.

The site is fully responsive—it works on computers, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Team Behind the Project

This project was created by three second-year students from the University of Porto's Communications degree program (specializing in Journalism, Public Relations, and Multimedia):

- **Beatriz Castro** - Documentary Researcher & Producer
- **Carolina Pinto** - Multimedia Designer & Content Curator
- **Diana Tavares** - Web Developer & Visual Strategist

The project was developed as part of their **Multimedia Workshop** (Atelier Multimédia) coursework, demonstrating real-world skills in documentary filmmaking, web design, and multimedia production.

## Features & Design

### Interactive Navigation

Visitors can easily move between pages using a retro-style navigation menu. The design evokes the Windows 95 operating system—a nostalgic reference that adds character to the experience.

### Photo Carousels

Each collector's page features an interactive photo carousel (slideshow) where visitors can browse through collection images at their own pace or let them auto-advance.

### Embedded Videos

High-quality interview videos are embedded directly into each collector's page, allowing visitors to hear the collectors' own words about their passions.

### Responsive Design

The layout automatically adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience whether viewing on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

### Retro Aesthetic

The design intentionally uses Windows 95 visual elements (beveled buttons, specific color schemes, retro cursor styles) as a creative choice that gives the site personality and makes it memorable.

## Technical Approach (For Context)

The project is built with:

- **HTML** - Page structure and content
- **CSS** - Visual styling and layout
- **JavaScript** - Interactive features (carousel controls, page navigation)
- **Bootstrap 5** - Responsive grid layout

No server or backend required—it's a "static" website that runs entirely in the browser.

## Educational Value

This project demonstrates:

- **Documentary Skills**: Research, interviewing, storytelling
- **Multimedia Production**: Video integration, photo curation, audio design
- **Web Design**: User experience, responsive layout, visual hierarchy
- **Project Management**: Coordinating a multi-person team, managing assets, delivering a complete product

## Project Statistics

- **3 collectors** featured with full profiles
- **25+ collection photos** across all galleries
- **3 professional interview videos** integrated
- **1 interactive quiz** about the collectors
- **4 navigation pages** (Home, About, Conclusion, About Us)
- **Fully custom design** inspired by retro computing aesthetics

## How to Experience It

1. **Start at the homepage** - Learn what collecting means and watch the trailer
2. **Choose a collector** - Click on their name or the folder icon to visit their profile
3. **Watch & explore** - View the interview video and browse their collection photos
4. **Read their story** - Discover what drives their passion for collecting
5. **Take the quiz** - Test your knowledge on the Conclusion page
6. **Learn about the team** - Visit the "About Us" section to meet the creators

## The Bigger Picture

Web documentaries are an emerging media format where traditional documentary storytelling meets interactive web design. This project shows how digital media can make documentary content more engaging and accessible than traditional films.

Rather than passively watching a 90-minute documentary, visitors here can:

- Choose which collector to learn about first
- Control the pace of the photo galleries
- Rewatch interviews at any time
- Share specific pages with friends

This interactivity makes the content feel more personal and engaging.

## Why This Matters

Collecting reveals how people form identity and community around shared interests. By spotlighting these three passionate collectors, the documentary celebrates a cultural practice that's often dismissed as hoarding but is actually driven by genuine passion, connection, and creativity.

This project shows how multimedia storytelling can document real people's lives in authentic, respectful, and engaging ways.
